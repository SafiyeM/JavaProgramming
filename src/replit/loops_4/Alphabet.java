/*
### Use a `loop` to print the alphabet from `A` to `Z`. Print all the characters in one line, with no spaces between them.

### Also use another `loop` to print the alphabet from `z` to `a`. Print all the character in one line, with no spaces between them.

#### Note: There will be two lines in the output. One of the uppercase letters from `A` to `Z`,
 and a second line for the lowercase letter from `z` to `a`.

#### Note: Do not just print the characters as a String, use a loop to iterate through all the characters

Main topics: loops, primitive data types

Example Flow:
```
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
