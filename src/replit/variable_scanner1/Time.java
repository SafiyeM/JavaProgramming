/*
### In this task, you will need to use multiple variables and combine them together into the time of the day.
```
  For example it will be something like this:
    12:24:33 PM
```


1. In the beginning of the code, declare three `int` variables: `hour, minute, second` and declare a `String` variable: `amOrPm`.
> You only need to declare, no assignment.

2. In the middle of the code, the variables will be assigned a value using Scanner.
> Do not touch anything in this section.

3. In the end of the code, use the variables to put together and print the time of the day using the following format:

  ```
  hours:minutes:seconds amOrPm
  ```

Main topics: variables, primitive datatypes, String, Scanner, concatenation
