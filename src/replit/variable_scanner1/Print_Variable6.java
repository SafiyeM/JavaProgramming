/*
### Given two variables **`num`** and **`cost`** with values (from Scanner), write a statement to print those values following the example below.

**Note:** You don't need to do anything with the Scanner.  Use the variable as done before.

Main topics: print statement, variables, primitive types, concatenation, Scanner

```
Ex:
  Input:
    2
    5

  Output:
    num = 2
    cost = 5.0
```
