We will start by going through the Palindrome and CountHi tasks from last week

	------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bot [while, Scanner, conditional]

	create a program that will make a simple bot that can talk with the user. when the program runs the user will be able to continue typing to the bot. Based on what the user says the bot will say something back. Use the following sample set up, but be creative and add more to the bot

	user says | >bot responds

	hello | > world
	what is your age | > I was programmed in March
	who created you | > I was created by Saim (use your name)
	what can we talk about | > print a menu of the options the bot can respond to

	off | > haha you cannot turn me off I am invincible
	shutdown | > SHUTTING DOWN (program ends, user cannot type anymore)

	------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shopping List [do while, String] [Simpler Version of the advance replit task]

	create a program that create a shopping list for the user. The program will ask the user to enter the items one by one.

	the flow:
		ask the user for the item
		add item to the shopping list
		ask user if they want to add more items

	when the user is done creating the list print it

	------------------------------------------------------------------------

[IQ] Prime in range [nested loop, methods, conditional]

	create a method that will accept a number. Print out all the prime numbers in the range between 2 and the given number

	a number is a prime number when it is only divisible by 1 and itself

	ex:
		Input:
			50
		Output:
			2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47

	------------------------------------------------------------------------

Address [object type]

	create a class called Address
	declare these instance variables:
		street, city, state, zipcode, country

	create a setInfo() method to initialize these variables

	create a toString() that shows the full address in the following format
		$street
		$city, $state $zipcode
		$country

	create a different class and create some Address objects

	------------------------------------------------------------------------

Item [object type]

	create a class called Item
	declare these instance variables:
		name, quantity, unitPrice

	create a setInfo() method to initialize these variables

	create a sellItem method that will accept an argument for how many items you want to buy
		first check if there is enough quantity left of the item
			if there is enough print:
				Selling: $quantity $name for $totalPrice
					- calculate the totalPrice by doing the quantity being bought and unitPrice
					- afterward reduce the quantity of the item from how many were sold

	create a toString() that shows the item information in the following format:
		ITEM: $name | $quantity | $unitPrice

	create a different class and create some Item objects
